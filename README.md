# heart-sweater

this pattern was originally made by alexandriamasse.com and a link to the original pattern itself without my little touches of readability is https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ubwy-rqa_qddu8GXxBUaezXOawP7is-a/view

all credit goes to her, as i have not made this pattern!! like mentioned beforehand, this is just so it may be a little more readable and have some small tweaks and techniques that i like to use and will explain as i write such as how i turn my work and having straight row edges.
