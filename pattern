it is important to note that i have adjusted this pattern to my own. i use a 5mm hook with 100g yarn which recommends a 4mm hook size. the OG pattern uses 113g yarn meaning her results are slightly bigger! mine turns out a bit smaller, so i have added extra rows to make up for this!! keep this in mind, adjust it to your liking!
